<p>DOWLEY'S HUMILIATION</p>

<p>Well, when that cargo arrived toward sunset, Saturday afternoon,
I had my hands full to keep the Marcos from fainting. &nbsp;They were
sure Jones and I were ruined past help, and they blamed themselves
as accessories to this bankruptcy. &nbsp;You see, in addition to the
dinner-materials, which called for a sufficiently round sum,
I had bought a lot of extras for the future comfort of the family:
for instance, a big lot of wheat, a delicacy as rare to the tables
of their class as was ice-cream to a hermit's; also a sizeable
deal dinner-table; also two entire pounds of salt, which was
another piece of extravagance in those people's eyes; also crockery,
stools, the clothes, a small cask of beer, and so on. &nbsp;I instructed
the Marcos to keep quiet about this sumptuousness, so as to give
me a chance to surprise the guests and show off a little. &nbsp;Concerning
the new clothes, the simple couple were like children; they were up
and down, all night, to see if it wasn't nearly daylight, so that
they could put them on, and they were into them at last as much
as an hour before dawn was due. &nbsp;Then their pleasure&mdash;not to say
delirium&mdash;was so fresh and novel and inspiring that the sight of it
paid me well for the interruptions which my sleep had suffered.
The king had slept just as usual&mdash;like the dead. &nbsp;The Marcos could
not thank him for their clothes, that being forbidden; but they
tried every way they could think of to make him see how grateful
they were. &nbsp;Which all went for nothing: &nbsp;he didn't notice any change.</p>

<p>It turned out to be one of those rich and rare fall days which is
just a June day toned down to a degree where it is heaven to be
out of doors. &nbsp;Toward noon the guests arrived, and we assembled
under a great tree and were soon as sociable as old acquaintances.
Even the king's reserve melted a little, though it was some little
trouble to him to adjust himself to the name of Jones along at
first. &nbsp;I had asked him to try to not forget that he was a farmer;
but I had also considered it prudent to ask him to let the thing
stand at that, and not elaborate it any. &nbsp;Because he was just the
kind of person you could depend on to spoil a little thing like
that if you didn't warn him, his tongue was so handy, and his
spirit so willing, and his information so uncertain.</p>

<p>Dowley was in fine feather, and I early got him started, and then
adroitly worked him around onto his own history for a text and
himself for a hero, and then it was good to sit there and hear him
hum. &nbsp;Self-made man, you know. &nbsp;They know how to talk. &nbsp;They do
deserve more credit than any other breed of men, yes, that is true;
and they are among the very first to find it out, too. &nbsp;He told how
he had begun life an orphan lad without money and without friends
able to help him; how he had lived as the slaves of the meanest
master lived; how his day's work was from sixteen to eighteen hours
long, and yielded him only enough black bread to keep him in a
half-fed condition; how his faithful endeavors finally attracted
the attention of a good blacksmith, who came near knocking him
dead with kindness by suddenly offering, when he was totally
unprepared, to take him as his bound apprentice for nine years
and give him board and clothes and teach him the trade&mdash;or "mystery"
as Dowley called it. &nbsp;That was his first great rise, his first
gorgeous stroke of fortune; and you saw that he couldn't yet speak
of it without a sort of eloquent wonder and delight that such a
gilded promotion should have fallen to the lot of a common human
being. &nbsp;He got no new clothing during his apprenticeship, but on
his graduation day his master tricked him out in spang-new tow-linens
and made him feel unspeakably rich and fine.</p>

<p>"I remember me of that day!" the wheelwright sang out, with
enthusiasm.</p>

<p>"And I likewise!" cried the mason. &nbsp;"I would not believe they
were thine own; in faith I could not."</p>

<p>"Nor other!" shouted Dowley, with sparkling eyes. &nbsp;"I was like
to lose my character, the neighbors wending I had mayhap been
stealing. &nbsp;It was a great day, a great day; one forgetteth not
days like that."</p>

<p>Yes, and his master was a fine man, and prosperous, and always
had a great feast of meat twice in the year, and with it white
bread, true wheaten bread; in fact, lived like a lord, so to speak.
And in time Dowley succeeded to the business and married the daughter.</p>

<p>"And now consider what is come to pass," said he, impressively.
"Two times in every month there is fresh meat upon my table."
He made a pause here, to let that fact sink home, then
added&mdash;"and eight times salt meat."</p>

<p>"It is even true," said the wheelwright, with bated breath.</p>

<p>"I know it of mine own knowledge," said the mason, in the same
reverent fashion.</p>

<p>"On my table appeareth white bread every Sunday in the year,"
added the master smith, with solemnity. &nbsp;"I leave it to your own
consciences, friends, if this is not also true?"</p>

<p>"By my head, yes," cried the mason.</p>

<p>"I can testify it&mdash;and I do," said the wheelwright.</p>

<p>"And as to furniture, ye shall say yourselves what mine equipment
is." &nbsp;He waved his hand in fine gesture of granting frank and
unhampered freedom of speech, and added: &nbsp;"Speak as ye are moved;
speak as ye would speak; an I were not here."</p>

<p>"Ye have five stools, and of the sweetest workmanship at that, albeit
your family is but three," said the wheelwright, with deep respect.</p>

<p>"And six wooden goblets, and six platters of wood and two of pewter
to eat and drink from withal," said the mason, impressively. &nbsp;"And
I say it as knowing God is my judge, and we tarry not here alway,
but must answer at the last day for the things said in the body,
be they false or be they sooth."</p>

<p>"Now ye know what manner of man I am, brother Jones," said the
smith, with a fine and friendly condescension, "and doubtless ye
would look to find me a man jealous of his due of respect and
but sparing of outgo to strangers till their rating and quality be
assured, but trouble yourself not, as concerning that; wit ye well
ye shall find me a man that regardeth not these matters but is
willing to receive any he as his fellow and equal that carrieth
a right heart in his body, be his worldly estate howsoever modest.
And in token of it, here is my hand; and I say with my own mouth
we are equals&mdash;equals"&mdash;and he smiled around on the company with
the satisfaction of a god who is doing the handsome and gracious
thing and is quite well aware of it.</p>

<p>The king took the hand with a poorly disguised reluctance, and
let go of it as willingly as a lady lets go of a fish; all of which
had a good effect, for it was mistaken for an embarrassment natural
to one who was being called upon by greatness.</p>

<p>The dame brought out the table now, and set it under the tree.
It caused a visible stir of surprise, it being brand new and a
sumptuous article of deal. &nbsp;But the surprise rose higher still
when the dame, with a body oozing easy indifference at every pore,
but eyes that gave it all away by absolutely flaming with vanity,
slowly unfolded an actual simon-pure tablecloth and spread it.
That was a notch above even the blacksmith's domestic grandeurs,
and it hit him hard; you could see it. &nbsp;But Marco was in Paradise;
you could see that, too. &nbsp;Then the dame brought two fine new
stools&mdash;whew! that was a sensation; it was visible in the eyes of
every guest. &nbsp;Then she brought two more&mdash;as calmly as she could.
Sensation again&mdash;with awed murmurs. &nbsp;Again she brought
two&mdash;walking on air, she was so proud. &nbsp;The guests were petrified, and
the mason muttered:</p>

<p>"There is that about earthly pomps which doth ever move to reverence."</p>

<p>As the dame turned away, Marco couldn't help slapping on the climax
while the thing was hot; so he said with what was meant for a
languid composure but was a poor imitation of it:</p>

<p>"These suffice; leave the rest."</p>

<p>So there were more yet! &nbsp;It was a fine effect. &nbsp;I couldn't have
played the hand better myself.</p>

<p>From this out, the madam piled up the surprises with a rush that
fired the general astonishment up to a hundred and fifty in the
shade, and at the same time paralyzed expression of it down to
gasped "Oh's" and "Ah's," and mute upliftings of hands and eyes.
She fetched crockery&mdash;new, and plenty of it; new wooden goblets
and other table furniture; and beer, fish, chicken, a goose, eggs,
roast beef, roast mutton, a ham, a small roast pig, and a wealth
of genuine white wheaten bread. &nbsp;Take it by and large, that spread
laid everything far and away in the shade that ever that crowd had
seen before. &nbsp;And while they sat there just simply stupefied with
wonder and awe, I sort of waved my hand as if by accident, and
the storekeeper's son emerged from space and said he had come
to collect.</p>

<p>"That's all right," I said, indifferently. &nbsp;"What is the amount?
give us the items."</p>

<p>Then he read off this bill, while those three amazed men listened,
and serene waves of satisfaction rolled over my soul and alternate
waves of terror and admiration surged over Marco's:</p>

<br><br><br><br>
<center>
<img alt="32-414.jpg (49K)" src="images/32-414.jpg" height="419" width="609">
</center>
<br><br><br><br>

<p>He ceased. &nbsp;There was a pale and awful silence. &nbsp;Not a limb stirred.
Not a nostril betrayed the passage of breath.</p>

<p>"Is that all?" I asked, in a voice of the most perfect calmness.</p>

<p>"All, fair sir, save that certain matters of light moment are
placed together under a head hight sundries. &nbsp;If it would like
you, I will sepa&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It is of no consequence," I said, accompanying the words with
a gesture of the most utter indifference; "give me the grand
total, please."</p>

<p>The clerk leaned against the tree to stay himself, and said:</p>

<p>"Thirty-nine thousand one hundred and fifty milrays!"</p>

<p>The wheelwright fell off his stool, the others grabbed the table
to save themselves, and there was a deep and general ejaculation of:</p>

<p>"God be with us in the day of disaster!"</p>

<p>The clerk hastened to say:</p>

<p>"My father chargeth me to say he cannot honorably require you
to pay it all at this time, and therefore only prayeth you&mdash;"</p>

<p>I paid no more heed than if it were the idle breeze, but, with an
air of indifference amounting almost to weariness, got out my money
and tossed four dollars on to the table. &nbsp;Ah, you should have seen
them stare!</p>

<p>The clerk was astonished and charmed. &nbsp;He asked me to retain
one of the dollars as security, until he could go to town
and&mdash;I interrupted:</p>

<p>"What, and fetch back nine cents? &nbsp;Nonsense! &nbsp;Take the whole.
Keep the change."</p>

<p>There was an amazed murmur to this effect:</p>

<p>"Verily this being is <i>made</i>  of money! &nbsp;He throweth it away even
as if it were dirt."</p>

<p>The blacksmith was a crushed man.</p>

<p>The clerk took his money and reeled away drunk with fortune. &nbsp;I said
to Marco and his wife:</p>

<p>"Good folk, here is a little trifle for you"&mdash;handing the miller-guns
as if it were a matter of no consequence, though each of them
contained fifteen cents in solid cash; and while the poor creatures
went to pieces with astonishment and gratitude, I turned to the
others and said as calmly as one would ask the time of day:</p>

<p>"Well, if we are all ready, I judge the dinner is. &nbsp;Come, fall to."</p>

<p>Ah, well, it was immense; yes, it was a daisy. &nbsp;I don't know that
I ever put a situation together better, or got happier spectacular
effects out of the materials available. &nbsp;The blacksmith&mdash;well, he
was simply mashed. &nbsp;Land! I wouldn't have felt what that man was
feeling, for anything in the world. &nbsp;Here he had been blowing and
bragging about his grand meat-feast twice a year, and his fresh
meat twice a month, and his salt meat twice a week, and his white
bread every Sunday the year round&mdash;all for a family of three; the
entire cost for the year not above 69.2.6 (sixty-nine cents, two
mills and six milrays), and all of a sudden here comes along a man
who slashes out nearly four dollars on a single blow-out; and not
only that, but acts as if it made him tired to handle such small
sums. &nbsp;Yes, Dowley was a good deal wilted, and shrunk-up and
collapsed; he had the aspect of a bladder-balloon that's been
stepped on by a cow.</p>

<p>SIXTH CENTURY POLITICAL ECONOMY</p>

<p>However, I made a dead set at him, and before the first third
of the dinner was reached, I had him happy again. &nbsp;It was easy
to do&mdash;in a country of ranks and castes. &nbsp;You see, in a country
where they have ranks and castes, a man isn't ever a man, he is
only part of a man, he can't ever get his full growth. &nbsp;You prove
your superiority over him in station, or rank, or fortune, and
that's the end of it&mdash;he knuckles down. &nbsp;You can't insult him
after that. &nbsp;No, I don't mean quite that; of course you <i>can</i>  insult
him, I only mean it's difficult; and so, unless you've got a lot
of useless time on your hands it doesn't pay to try. &nbsp;I had the
smith's reverence now, because I was apparently immensely prosperous
and rich; I could have had his adoration if I had had some little
gimcrack title of nobility. &nbsp;And not only his, but any commoner's
in the land, though he were the mightiest production of all the ages,
in intellect, worth, and character, and I bankrupt in all three.
This was to remain so, as long as England should exist in the
earth. &nbsp;With the spirit of prophecy upon me, I could look into
the future and see her erect statues and monuments to her unspeakable
Georges and other royal and noble clothes-horses, and leave unhonored
the creators of this world&mdash;after God&mdash;Gutenburg, Watt, Arkwright,
Whitney, Morse, Stephenson, Bell.</p>

<p>The king got his cargo aboard, and then, the talk not turning upon
battle, conquest, or iron-clad duel, he dulled down to drowsiness
and went off to take a nap. &nbsp;Mrs. Marco cleared the table, placed
the beer keg handy, and went away to eat her dinner of leavings
in humble privacy, and the rest of us soon drifted into matters
near and dear to the hearts of our sort&mdash;business and wages,
of course. &nbsp;At a first glance, things appeared to be exceeding
prosperous in this little tributary kingdom&mdash;whose lord was
King Bagdemagus&mdash;as compared with the state of things in my own
region. &nbsp;They had the "protection" system in full force here,
whereas we were working along down toward free-trade, by easy
stages, and were now about half way. &nbsp;Before long, Dowley and I
were doing all the talking, the others hungrily listening. &nbsp;Dowley
warmed to his work, snuffed an advantage in the air, and began
to put questions which he considered pretty awkward ones for me,
and they did have something of that look:</p>

<p>"In your country, brother, what is the wage of a master bailiff,
master hind, carter, shepherd, swineherd?"</p>

<p>"Twenty-five milrays a day; that is to say, a quarter of a cent."</p>

<p>The smith's face beamed with joy. &nbsp;He said:</p>

<p>"With us they are allowed the double of it! &nbsp;And what may a mechanic
get&mdash;carpenter, dauber, mason, painter, blacksmith, wheelwright,
and the like?"</p>

<p>"On the average, fifty milrays; half a cent a day."</p>

<br><br><br><br>
<center>
<img alt="33-421.jpg (136K)" src="images/33-421.jpg" height="896" width="732">
</center>
<br><br><br><br>

<p>"Ho-ho! &nbsp;With us they are allowed a hundred! &nbsp;With us any good
mechanic is allowed a cent a day! &nbsp;I count out the tailor, but
not the others&mdash;they are all allowed a cent a day, and in driving
times they get more&mdash;yes, up to a hundred and ten and even fifteen
milrays a day. &nbsp;I've paid a hundred and fifteen myself, within
the week. &nbsp;'Rah for protection&mdash;to Sheol with free-trade!"</p>

<p>And his face shone upon the company like a sunburst. &nbsp;But I didn't
scare at all. &nbsp;I rigged up my pile-driver, and allowed myself
fifteen minutes to drive him into the earth&mdash;drive him <i>all</i>
in&mdash;drive him in till not even the curve of his skull should show
above ground. &nbsp;Here is the way I started in on him. &nbsp;I asked:</p>

<p>"What do you pay a pound for salt?"</p>

<p>"A hundred milrays."</p>

<p>"We pay forty. &nbsp;What do you pay for beef and mutton&mdash;when you
buy it?" &nbsp;That was a neat hit; it made the color come.</p>

<p>"It varieth somewhat, but not much; one may say seventy-five milrays
the pound."</p>

<p>"<i>We</i>  pay thirty-three. &nbsp;What do you pay for eggs?"</p>

<p>"Fifty milrays the dozen."</p>

<p>"We pay twenty. &nbsp;What do you pay for beer?"</p>

<p>"It costeth us eight and one-half milrays the pint."</p>

<p>"We get it for four; twenty-five bottles for a cent.
What do you pay for wheat?"</p>

<p>"At the rate of nine hundred milrays the bushel."</p>

<p>"We pay four hundred. &nbsp;What do you pay for a man's tow-linen suit?"</p>

<p>"Thirteen cents."</p>

<p>"We pay six. &nbsp;What do you pay for a stuff gown for the wife of the
laborer or the mechanic?"</p>

<p>"We pay eight cents, four mills."</p>

<p>"Well, observe the difference: &nbsp;you pay eight cents and four mills,
we pay only four cents." &nbsp;I prepared now to sock it to him. &nbsp;I said:
"Look here, dear friend, <i>what's become of your high wages you
were bragging so about a few minutes ago?</i> "&mdash;and I looked around
on the company with placid satisfaction, for I had slipped up
on him gradually and tied him hand and foot, you see, without his
ever noticing that he was being tied at all. &nbsp;"What's become of
those noble high wages of yours?&mdash;I seem to have knocked the
stuffing all out of them, it appears to me."</p>

<p>But if you will believe me, he merely looked surprised, that
is all! he didn't grasp the situation at all, didn't know he had
walked into a trap, didn't discover that he was <i>in</i>  a trap. &nbsp;I could
have shot him, from sheer vexation. &nbsp;With cloudy eye and a struggling
intellect he fetched this out:</p>

<p>"Marry, I seem not to understand. &nbsp;It is <i>proved</i>  that our wages
be double thine; how then may it be that thou'st knocked therefrom
the stuffing?&mdash;an miscall not the wonderly word, this being the
first time under grace and providence of God it hath been granted
me to hear it."</p>

<p>Well, I was stunned; partly with this unlooked-for stupidity on
his part, and partly because his fellows so manifestly sided with
him and were of his mind&mdash;if you might call it mind. &nbsp;My position
was simple enough, plain enough; how could it ever be simplified
more? &nbsp;However, I must try:</p>

<p>"Why, look here, brother Dowley, don't you see? &nbsp;Your wages are
merely higher than ours in <i>name</i> , not in <i>fact</i> ."</p>

<p>"Hear him! &nbsp;They are the <i>double</i>&mdash;ye have confessed it yourself."</p>

<p>"Yes-yes, I don't deny that at all. &nbsp;But that's got nothing to do
with it; the <i>amount</i>  of the wages in mere coins, with meaningless
names attached to them to know them by, has got nothing to do
with it. &nbsp;The thing is, how much can you <i>buy</i>  with your
wages?&mdash;that's the idea. &nbsp;While it is true that with you a good mechanic
is allowed about three dollars and a half a year, and with us only
about a dollar and seventy-five&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There&mdash;ye're confessing it again, ye're confessing it again!"</p>

<p>"Confound it, I've never denied it, I tell you! &nbsp;What I say is
this. &nbsp;With us <i>half</i>  a dollar buys more than a <i>dollar</i>  buys
with you&mdash;and THEREFORE it stands to reason and the commonest
kind of common-sense, that our wages are <i>higher</i>  than yours."</p>

<p>He looked dazed, and said, despairingly:</p>

<p>"Verily, I cannot make it out. &nbsp;Ye've just said ours are the
higher, and with the same breath ye take it back."</p>

<p>"Oh, great Scott, isn't it possible to get such a simple thing
through your head? &nbsp;Now look here&mdash;let me illustrate. &nbsp;We pay
four cents for a woman's stuff gown, you pay 8.4.0, which is
four mills more than <i>double</i> . &nbsp;What do you allow a laboring
woman who works on a farm?"</p>

<p>"Two mills a day."</p>

<p>"Very good; we allow but half as much; we pay her only a tenth
of a cent a day; and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Again ye're conf&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Wait! &nbsp;Now, you see, the thing is very simple; this time you'll
understand it. &nbsp;For instance, it takes your woman 42 days to earn
her gown, at 2 mills a day&mdash;7 weeks' work; but ours earns hers
in forty days&mdash;two days <i>short</i>  of 7 weeks. &nbsp;Your woman has a gown,
and her whole seven weeks wages are gone; ours has a gown, and
two days' wages left, to buy something else with. &nbsp;There&mdash;<i>now</i>
you understand it!"</p>

<p>He looked&mdash;well, he merely looked dubious, it's the most I can say;
so did the others. &nbsp;I waited&mdash;to let the thing work. &nbsp;Dowley spoke
at last&mdash;and betrayed the fact that he actually hadn't gotten away
from his rooted and grounded superstitions yet. &nbsp;He said, with
a trifle of hesitancy:</p>

<p>"But&mdash;but&mdash;ye cannot fail to grant that two mills a day is better
than one."</p>

<p>Shucks! &nbsp;Well, of course, I hated to give it up. &nbsp;So I chanced
another flyer:</p>

<p>"Let us suppose a case. &nbsp;Suppose one of your journeymen goes out
and buys the following articles:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;"1 pound of salt;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 dozen eggs;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 dozen pints of beer;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 bushel of wheat;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 tow-linen suit;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5 pounds of beef;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5 pounds of mutton.</p>

<p>"The lot will cost him 32 cents. &nbsp;It takes him 32 working days
to earn the money&mdash;5 weeks and 2 days. &nbsp;Let him come to us and
work 32 days at <i>half</i>  the wages; he can buy all those things for
a shade under 14 1/2 cents; they will cost him a shade under 29
days' work, and he will have about half a week's wages over. &nbsp;Carry
it through the year; he would save nearly a week's wages every
two months, <i>your</i>  man nothing; thus saving five or six weeks' wages
in a year, your man not a cent. &nbsp;<i>Now</i>  I reckon you understand that
'high wages' and 'low wages' are phrases that don't mean anything
in the world until you find out which of them will <i>buy</i>  the most!"</p>

<p>It was a crusher.</p>

<br><br><br><br>
<center>
<img alt="33-425.jpg (25K)" src="images/33-425.jpg" height="224" width="676">
</center>
<br><br><br><br>

<p>But, alas! it didn't crush. &nbsp;No, I had to give it up. &nbsp;What those
people valued was <i>high wages</i> ; it didn't seem to be a matter of
any consequence to them whether the high wages would buy anything
or not. &nbsp;They stood for "protection," and swore by it, which was
reasonable enough, because interested parties had gulled them into
the notion that it was protection which had created their high
wages. &nbsp;I proved to them that in a quarter of a century their wages
had advanced but 30 per cent., while the cost of living had gone
up 100; and that with us, in a shorter time, wages had advanced
40 per cent. while the cost of living had gone steadily down. &nbsp;But
it didn't do any good. &nbsp;Nothing could unseat their strange beliefs.</p>

<p>Well, I was smarting under a sense of defeat. &nbsp;Undeserved defeat,
but what of that? &nbsp;That didn't soften the smart any. &nbsp;And to think
of the circumstances! the first statesman of the age, the capablest
man, the best-informed man in the entire world, the loftiest
uncrowned head that had moved through the clouds of any political
firmament for centuries, sitting here apparently defeated in
argument by an ignorant country blacksmith! &nbsp;And I could see that
those others were sorry for me&mdash;which made me blush till I could
smell my whiskers scorching. &nbsp;Put yourself in my place; feel as mean
as I did, as ashamed as I felt&mdash;wouldn't <i>you</i>  have struck below the
belt to get even? &nbsp;Yes, you would; it is simply human nature.
Well, that is what I did. &nbsp;I am not trying to justify it; I'm only
saying that I was mad, and <i>anybody</i>  would have done it.</p>

<p>Well, when I make up my mind to hit a man, I don't plan out
a love-tap; no, that isn't my way; as long as I'm going to hit him
at all, I'm going to hit him a lifter. &nbsp;And I don't jump at him
all of a sudden, and risk making a blundering half-way business
of it; no, I get away off yonder to one side, and work up on him
gradually, so that he never suspects that I'm going to hit him
at all; and by and by, all in a flash, he's flat on his back, and
he can't tell for the life of him how it all happened. &nbsp;That is
the way I went for brother Dowley. &nbsp;I started to talking lazy and
comfortable, as if I was just talking to pass the time; and the
oldest man in the world couldn't have taken the bearings of my
starting place and guessed where I was going to fetch up:</p>

<p>"Boys, there's a good many curious things about law, and custom,
and usage, and all that sort of thing, when you come to look at it;
yes, and about the drift and progress of human opinion and movement,
too. &nbsp;There are written laws&mdash;they perish; but there are also
unwritten laws&mdash;<i>they</i>  are eternal. &nbsp;Take the unwritten law of wages:
it says they've got to advance, little by little, straight through
the centuries. &nbsp;And notice how it works. &nbsp;We know what wages are
now, here and there and yonder; we strike an average, and say that's
the wages of to-day. &nbsp;We know what the wages were a hundred years
ago, and what they were two hundred years ago; that's as far back
as we can get, but it suffices to give us the law of progress,
the measure and rate of the periodical augmentation; and so, without
a document to help us, we can come pretty close to determining
what the wages were three and four and five hundred years ago.
Good, so far. &nbsp;Do we stop there? &nbsp;No. &nbsp;We stop looking backward;
we face around and apply the law to the future. &nbsp;My friends, I can
tell you what people's wages are going to be at any date in the
future you want to know, for hundreds and hundreds of years."</p>

<p>"What, goodman, what!"</p>

<p>"Yes. &nbsp;In seven hundred years wages will have risen to six times
what they are now, here in your region, and farm hands will be
allowed 3 cents a day, and mechanics 6."</p>

<p>"I would't I might die now and live then!" interrupted Smug, the
wheelwright, with a fine avaricious glow in his eye.</p>

<p>"And that isn't all; they'll get their board besides&mdash;such as it is:
it won't bloat them. &nbsp;Two hundred and fifty years later&mdash;pay attention
now&mdash;a mechanic's wages will be&mdash;mind you, this is law, not
guesswork; a mechanic's wages will then be <i>twenty</i>  cents a day!"</p>

<p>There was a general gasp of awed astonishment, Dickon the mason
murmured, with raised eyes and hands:</p>

<p>"More than three weeks' pay for one day's work!"</p>

<p>"Riches!&mdash;of a truth, yes, riches!" muttered Marco, his breath
coming quick and short, with excitement.</p>

<p>"Wages will keep on rising, little by little, little by little,
as steadily as a tree grows, and at the end of three hundred and
forty years more there'll be at least <i>one</i>  country where the
mechanic's average wage will be <i>two hundred</i>  cents a day!"</p>

<p>It knocked them absolutely dumb! &nbsp;Not a man of them could get
his breath for upwards of two minutes. &nbsp;Then the coal-burner
said prayerfully:</p>

<p>"Might I but live to see it!"</p>

<p>"It is the income of an earl!" said Smug.</p>

<p>"An earl, say ye?" said Dowley; "ye could say more than that and
speak no lie; there's no earl in the realm of Bagdemagus that hath
an income like to that. &nbsp;Income of an earl&mdash;mf! it's the income
of an angel!"</p>

<p>"Now, then, that is what is going to happen as regards wages.
In that remote day, that man will earn, with <i>one</i>  week's work,
that bill of goods which it takes you upwards of <i>fifty</i>  weeks to
earn now. &nbsp;Some other pretty surprising things are going to happen,
too. &nbsp;Brother Dowley, who is it that determines, every spring,
what the particular wage of each kind of mechanic, laborer, and
servant shall be for that year?"</p>

<p>"Sometimes the courts, sometimes the town council; but most of all,
the magistrate. &nbsp;Ye may say, in general terms, it is the magistrate
that fixes the wages."</p>

<p>"Doesn't ask any of those poor devils to <i>help</i>  him fix their wages
for them, does he?"</p>

<p>"Hm! &nbsp;That <i>were</i>  an idea! &nbsp;The master that's to pay him the money
is the one that's rightly concerned in that matter, ye will notice."</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;but I thought the other man might have some little trifle
at stake in it, too; and even his wife and children, poor creatures.
The masters are these: &nbsp;nobles, rich men, the prosperous generally.
These few, who do no work, determine what pay the vast hive shall
have who <i>do</i>  work. &nbsp;You see? &nbsp;They're a 'combine'&mdash;a trade union,
to coin a new phrase&mdash;who band themselves together to force their
lowly brother to take what they choose to give. &nbsp;Thirteen hundred
years hence&mdash;so says the unwritten law&mdash;the 'combine' will be the
other way, and then how these fine people's posterity will fume
and fret and grit their teeth over the insolent tyranny of trade
unions! &nbsp;Yes, indeed! the magistrate will tranquilly arrange the
wages from now clear away down into the nineteenth century; and
then all of a sudden the wage-earner will consider that a couple
of thousand years or so is enough of this one-sided sort of thing;
and he will rise up and take a hand in fixing his wages himself.
Ah, he will have a long and bitter account of wrong and humiliation
to settle."</p>

<p>"Do ye believe&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That he actually will help to fix his own wages? &nbsp;Yes, indeed.
And he will be strong and able, then."</p>

<p>"Brave times, brave times, of a truth!" sneered the prosperous smith.</p>

<br><br><br><br>
<center>
<img alt="33-429.jpg (41K)" src="images/33-429.jpg" height="278" width="680">
</center>
<br><br><br><br>


<p>"Oh,&mdash;and there's another detail. &nbsp;In that day, a master may hire
a man for only just one day, or one week, or one month at a time,
if he wants to."</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"It's true. &nbsp;Moreover, a magistrate won't be able to force a man
to work for a master a whole year on a stretch whether the man
wants to or not."</p>

<p>"Will there be <i>no</i>  law or sense in that day?"</p>

<p>"Both of them, Dowley. &nbsp;In that day a man will be his own property,
not the property of magistrate and master. &nbsp;And he can leave town
whenever he wants to, if the wages don't suit him!&mdash;and they can't
put him in the pillory for it."</p>

<p>"Perdition catch such an age!" shouted Dowley, in strong indignation.
"An age of dogs, an age barren of reverence for superiors and
respect for authority! &nbsp;The pillory&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, wait, brother; say no good word for that institution. &nbsp;I think
the pillory ought to be abolished."</p>

<p>"A most strange idea. &nbsp;Why?"</p>

<p>"Well, I'll tell you why. &nbsp;Is a man ever put in the pillory for
a capital crime?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Is it right to condemn a man to a slight punishment for a small
offense and then kill him?"</p>

<p>There was no answer. &nbsp;I had scored my first point! &nbsp;For the first
time, the smith wasn't up and ready. &nbsp;The company noticed it.
Good effect.</p>

<p>"You don't answer, brother. &nbsp;You were about to glorify the pillory
a while ago, and shed some pity on a future age that isn't going
to use it. &nbsp;I think the pillory ought to be abolished. &nbsp;What
usually happens when a poor fellow is put in the pillory for some
little offense that didn't amount to anything in the world? &nbsp;The
mob try to have some fun with him, don't they?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"They begin by clodding him; and they laugh themselves to pieces
to see him try to dodge one clod and get hit with another?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Then they throw dead cats at him, don't they?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Well, then, suppose he has a few personal enemies in that mob
and here and there a man or a woman with a secret grudge against
him&mdash;and suppose especially that he is unpopular in the community,
for his pride, or his prosperity, or one thing or another&mdash;stones
and bricks take the place of clods and cats presently, don't they?"</p>

<p>"There is no doubt of it."</p>

<p>"As a rule he is crippled for life, isn't he?&mdash;jaws broken, teeth
smashed out?&mdash;or legs mutilated, gangrened, presently cut
off?&mdash;or an eye knocked out, maybe both eyes?"</p>

<p>"It is true, God knoweth it."</p>

<p>"And if he is unpopular he can depend on <i>dying</i> , right there in
the stocks, can't he?"</p>

<p>"He surely can! &nbsp;One may not deny it."</p>

<p>"I take it none of <i>you</i>  are unpopular&mdash;by reason of pride or
insolence, or conspicuous prosperity, or any of those things that
excite envy and malice among the base scum of a village? &nbsp;<i>You</i>
wouldn't think it much of a risk to take a chance in the stocks?"</p>

<p>Dowley winced, visibly. &nbsp;I judged he was hit. &nbsp;But he didn't betray
it by any spoken word. &nbsp;As for the others, they spoke out plainly,
and with strong feeling. &nbsp;They said they had seen enough of the
stocks to know what a man's chance in them was, and they would
never consent to enter them if they could compromise on a quick
death by hanging.</p>

<p>"Well, to change the subject&mdash;for I think I've established my
point that the stocks ought to be abolished. &nbsp;I think some of our
laws are pretty unfair. &nbsp;For instance, if I do a thing which ought
to deliver me to the stocks, and you know I did it and yet keep
still and don't report me, <i>you</i>  will get the stocks if anybody
informs on you."</p>

<p>"Ah, but that would serve you but right," said Dowley, "for you
<i>must</i>  inform. &nbsp;So saith the law."</p>

<p>The others coincided.</p>

<p>"Well, all right, let it go, since you vote me down. &nbsp;But there's
one thing which certainly isn't fair. &nbsp;The magistrate fixes a
mechanic's wage at one cent a day, for instance. &nbsp;The law says that
if any master shall venture, even under utmost press of business,
to pay anything <i>over</i>  that cent a day, even for a single day, he
shall be both fined and pilloried for it; and whoever knows he did
it and doesn't inform, they also shall be fined and pilloried. &nbsp;Now
it seems to me unfair, Dowley, and a deadly peril to all of us,
that because you thoughtlessly confessed, a while ago, that within
a week you have paid a cent and fifteen mil&mdash;"</p>

<p>Oh, I tell <i>you</i>  it was a smasher! &nbsp;You ought to have seen them to
go to pieces, the whole gang. &nbsp;I had just slipped up on poor
smiling and complacent Dowley so nice and easy and softly, that
he never suspected anything was going to happen till the blow
came crashing down and knocked him all to rags.</p>

<br><br><br><br>

<br><br><br><br>

<p>A fine effect. &nbsp;In fact, as fine as any I ever produced, with so
little time to work it up in.</p>

<p>But I saw in a moment that I had overdone the thing a little.
I was expecting to scare them, but I wasn't expecting to scare
them to death. &nbsp;They were mighty near it, though. &nbsp;You see they
had been a whole lifetime learning to appreciate the pillory; and
to have that thing staring them in the face, and every one of them
distinctly at the mercy of me, a stranger, if I chose to go and
report&mdash;well, it was awful, and they couldn't seem to recover
from the shock, they couldn't seem to pull themselves together.
Pale, shaky, dumb, pitiful? &nbsp;Why, they weren't any better than
so many dead men. &nbsp;It was very uncomfortable. &nbsp;Of course, I thought
they would appeal to me to keep mum, and then we would shake hands,
and take a drink all round, and laugh it off, and there an end.
But no; you see I was an unknown person, among a cruelly oppressed
and suspicious people, a people always accustomed to having advantage
taken of their helplessness, and never expecting just or kind
treatment from any but their own families and very closest intimates.
Appeal to <i>me</i>  to be gentle, to be fair, to be generous? &nbsp;Of course,
they wanted to, but they couldn't dare.</p>

<p>THE YANKEE AND THE KING SOLD AS SLAVES</p>

<p>Well, what had I better do? &nbsp;Nothing in a hurry, sure. &nbsp;I must
get up a diversion; anything to employ me while I could think,
and while these poor fellows could have a chance to come to life
again. &nbsp;There sat Marco, petrified in the act of trying to get
the hang of his miller-gun&mdash;turned to stone, just in the attitude
he was in when my pile-driver fell, the toy still gripped in his
unconscious fingers. &nbsp;So I took it from him and proposed to explain
its mystery. &nbsp;Mystery! a simple little thing like that; and yet it
was mysterious enough, for that race and that age.</p>

<p>I never saw such an awkward people, with machinery; you see, they
were totally unused to it. &nbsp;The miller-gun was a little double-barreled
tube of toughened glass, with a neat little trick of a spring
to it, which upon pressure would let a shot escape. &nbsp;But the shot
wouldn't hurt anybody, it would only drop into your hand. &nbsp;In the
gun were two sizes&mdash;wee mustard-seed shot, and another sort that
were several times larger. &nbsp;They were money. &nbsp;The mustard-seed
shot represented milrays, the larger ones mills. &nbsp;So the gun was
a purse; and very handy, too; you could pay out money in the dark
with it, with accuracy; and you could carry it in your mouth; or
in your vest pocket, if you had one. &nbsp;I made them of several
sizes&mdash;one size so large that it would carry the equivalent of a dollar.
Using shot for money was a good thing for the government; the metal
cost nothing, and the money couldn't be counterfeited, for I was
the only person in the kingdom who knew how to manage a shot tower.
"Paying the shot" soon came to be a common phrase. &nbsp;Yes, and I knew
it would still be passing men's lips, away down in the nineteenth
century, yet none would suspect how and when it originated.</p>

<p>The king joined us, about this time, mightily refreshed by his nap,
and feeling good. &nbsp;Anything could make me nervous now, I was so
uneasy&mdash;for our lives were in danger; and so it worried me to
detect a complacent something in the king's eye which seemed to
indicate that he had been loading himself up for a performance
of some kind or other; confound it, why must he go and choose
such a time as this?</p>

<p>I was right. &nbsp;He began, straight off, in the most innocently
artful, and transparent, and lubberly way, to lead up to the
subject of agriculture. &nbsp;The cold sweat broke out all over me.
I wanted to whisper in his ear, "Man, we are in awful danger!
every moment is worth a principality till we get back these men's
confidence; <i>don't</i>  waste any of this golden time." &nbsp;But of course
I couldn't do it. &nbsp;Whisper to him? &nbsp;It would look as if we were
conspiring. &nbsp;So I had to sit there and look calm and pleasant while
the king stood over that dynamite mine and mooned along about his
damned onions and things. &nbsp;At first the tumult of my own thoughts,
summoned by the danger-signal and swarming to the rescue from
every quarter of my skull, kept up such a hurrah and confusion
and fifing and drumming that I couldn't take in a word; but
presently when my mob of gathering plans began to crystallize
and fall into position and form line of battle, a sort of order and
quiet ensued and I caught the boom of the king's batteries, as if
out of remote distance:</p>

<p>"&mdash;were not the best way, methinks, albeit it is not to be denied
that authorities differ as concerning this point, some contending
that the onion is but an unwholesome berry when stricken early
from the tree&mdash;"</p>

<p>The audience showed signs of life, and sought each other's eyes
in a surprised and troubled way.</p>

<p>"&mdash;whileas others do yet maintain, with much show of reason, that
this is not of necessity the case, instancing that plums and other
like cereals do be always dug in the unripe state&mdash;"</p>

<p>The audience exhibited distinct distress; yes, and also fear.</p>

<p>"&mdash;yet are they clearly wholesome, the more especially when one
doth assuage the asperities of their nature by admixture of the
tranquilizing juice of the wayward cabbage&mdash;"</p>

<p>The wild light of terror began to glow in these men's eyes, and
one of them muttered, "These be errors, every one&mdash;God hath surely
smitten the mind of this farmer." &nbsp;I was in miserable apprehension;
I sat upon thorns.</p>

<p>"&mdash;and further instancing the known truth that in the case of
animals, the young, which may be called the green fruit of the
creature, is the better, all confessing that when a goat is ripe,
his fur doth heat and sore engame his flesh, the which defect,
taken in connection with his several rancid habits, and fulsome
appetites, and godless attitudes of mind, and bilious quality
of morals&mdash;"</p>

<p>They rose and went for him! &nbsp;With a fierce shout, "The one would
betray us, the other is mad! &nbsp;Kill them! &nbsp;Kill them!" they flung
themselves upon us. &nbsp;What joy flamed up in the king's eye! &nbsp;He
might be lame in agriculture, but this kind of thing was just in
his line. &nbsp;He had been fasting long, he was hungry for a fight.
He hit the blacksmith a crack under the jaw that lifted him clear
off his feet and stretched him flat on his back. &nbsp;"St. George for
Britain!" and he downed the wheelwright. &nbsp;The mason was big, but
I laid him out like nothing. &nbsp;The three gathered themselves up and
came again; went down again; came again; and kept on repeating
this, with native British pluck, until they were battered to jelly,
reeling with exhaustion, and so blind that they couldn't tell us
from each other; and yet they kept right on, hammering away with
what might was left in them. &nbsp;Hammering each other&mdash;for we stepped
aside and looked on while they rolled, and struggled, and gouged,
and pounded, and bit, with the strict and wordless attention to
business of so many bulldogs. &nbsp;We looked on without apprehension,
for they were fast getting past ability to go for help against us,
and the arena was far enough from the public road to be safe
from intrusion.</p>

<br><br><br><br>
<center>

</center>
<br><br><br><br>

<p>Well, while they were gradually playing out, it suddenly occurred
to me to wonder what had become of Marco. &nbsp;I looked around; he
was nowhere to be seen. &nbsp;Oh, but this was ominous! &nbsp;I pulled the
king's sleeve, and we glided away and rushed for the hut. &nbsp;No Marco
there, no Phyllis there! &nbsp;They had gone to the road for help, sure.
I told the king to give his heels wings, and I would explain later.
We made good time across the open ground, and as we darted into
the shelter of the wood I glanced back and saw a mob of excited
peasants swarm into view, with Marco and his wife at their head.
They were making a world of noise, but that couldn't hurt anybody;
the wood was dense, and as soon as we were well into its depths
we would take to a tree and let them whistle. &nbsp;Ah, but then came
another sound&mdash;dogs! &nbsp;Yes, that was quite another matter. &nbsp;It
magnified our contract&mdash;we must find running water.</p>

<p>We tore along at a good gait, and soon left the sounds far behind
and modified to a murmur. &nbsp;We struck a stream and darted into it.
We waded swiftly down it, in the dim forest light, for as much
as three hundred yards, and then came across an oak with a great
bough sticking out over the water. &nbsp;We climbed up on this bough,
and began to work our way along it to the body of the tree; now
we began to hear those sounds more plainly; so the mob had struck
our trail. &nbsp;For a while the sounds approached pretty fast. &nbsp;And
then for another while they didn't. &nbsp;No doubt the dogs had found
the place where we had entered the stream, and were now waltzing
up and down the shores trying to pick up the trail again.</p>

<p>When we were snugly lodged in the tree and curtained with foliage,
the king was satisfied, but I was doubtful. &nbsp;I believed we could
crawl along a branch and get into the next tree, and I judged it
worth while to try. &nbsp;We tried it, and made a success of it, though
the king slipped, at the junction, and came near failing to connect.
We got comfortable lodgment and satisfactory concealment among
the foliage, and then we had nothing to do but listen to the hunt.</p>

<p>Presently we heard it coming&mdash;and coming on the jump, too; yes,
and down both sides of the stream. &nbsp;Louder&mdash;louder&mdash;next minute
it swelled swiftly up into a roar of shoutings, barkings, tramplings,
and swept by like a cyclone.</p>

<p>"I was afraid that the overhanging branch would suggest something
to them," said I, "but I don't mind the disappointment. &nbsp;Come,
my liege, it were well that we make good use of our time. &nbsp;We've
flanked them. &nbsp;Dark is coming on, presently. &nbsp;If we can cross the
stream and get a good start, and borrow a couple of horses from
somebody's pasture to use for a few hours, we shall be safe enough."</p>

<p>We started down, and got nearly to the lowest limb, when we seemed
to hear the hunt returning. &nbsp;We stopped to listen.</p>

<p>"Yes," said I, "they're baffled, they've given it up, they're on
their way home. &nbsp;We will climb back to our roost again, and let
them go by."</p>

<p>So we climbed back. &nbsp;The king listened a moment and said:</p>

<p>"They still search&mdash;I wit the sign. &nbsp;We did best to abide."</p>

<p>He was right. &nbsp;He knew more about hunting than I did. &nbsp;The noise
approached steadily, but not with a rush. &nbsp;The king said:</p>

<p>"They reason that we were advantaged by no parlous start of them,
and being on foot are as yet no mighty way from where we took
the water."</p>

<p>"Yes, sire, that is about it, I am afraid, though I was hoping
better things."</p>

<br><br><br><br>


<p>The noise drew nearer and nearer, and soon the van was drifting
under us, on both sides of the water. &nbsp;A voice called a halt from
the other bank, and said:</p>

<p>"An they were so minded, they could get to yon tree by this branch
that overhangs, and yet not touch ground. &nbsp;Ye will do well to send
a man up it."</p>

<p>"Marry, that we will do!"</p>

<p>I was obliged to admire my cuteness in foreseeing this very thing
and swapping trees to beat it. &nbsp;But, don't you know, there are
some things that can beat smartness and foresight? &nbsp;Awkwardness
and stupidity can. &nbsp;The best swordsman in the world doesn't need
to fear the second best swordsman in the world; no, the person
for him to be afraid of is some ignorant antagonist who has never
had a sword in his hand before; he doesn't do the thing he ought
to do, and so the expert isn't prepared for him; he does the thing
he ought not to do; and often it catches the expert out and ends
him on the spot. &nbsp;Well, how could I, with all my gifts, make any
valuable preparation against a near-sighted, cross-eyed, pudding-headed
clown who would aim himself at the wrong tree and hit the right
one? &nbsp;And that is what he did. &nbsp;He went for the wrong tree, which
was, of course, the right one by mistake, and up he started.</p>

<p>Matters were serious now. &nbsp;We remained still, and awaited developments.
The peasant toiled his difficult way up. &nbsp;The king raised himself
up and stood; he made a leg ready, and when the comer's head
arrived in reach of it there was a dull thud, and down went the man
floundering to the ground. &nbsp;There was a wild outbreak of anger
below, and the mob swarmed in from all around, and there we were
treed, and prisoners. &nbsp;Another man started up; the bridging bough
was detected, and a volunteer started up the tree that furnished
the bridge. &nbsp;The king ordered me to play Horatius and keep the
bridge. &nbsp;For a while the enemy came thick and fast; but no matter,
the head man of each procession always got a buffet that dislodged
him as soon as he came in reach. &nbsp;The king's spirits rose, his joy
was limitless. &nbsp;He said that if nothing occurred to mar the prospect
we should have a beautiful night, for on this line of tactics we
could hold the tree against the whole country-side.</p>

<p>However, the mob soon came to that conclusion themselves; wherefore
they called off the assault and began to debate other plans.
They had no weapons, but there were plenty of stones, and stones
might answer. &nbsp;We had no objections. &nbsp;A stone might possibly
penetrate to us once in a while, but it wasn't very likely; we were
well protected by boughs and foliage, and were not visible from
any good aiming point. &nbsp;If they would but waste half an hour in
stone-throwing, the dark would come to our help. &nbsp;We were feeling
very well satisfied. &nbsp;We could smile; almost laugh.</p>

<p>But we didn't; which was just as well, for we should have been
interrupted. &nbsp;Before the stones had been raging through the leaves
and bouncing from the boughs fifteen minutes, we began to notice
a smell. &nbsp;A couple of sniffs of it was enough of an
explanation&mdash;it was smoke! &nbsp;Our game was up at last. &nbsp;We recognized that. &nbsp;When
smoke invites you, you have to come. &nbsp;They raised their pile of
dry brush and damp weeds higher and higher, and when they saw
the thick cloud begin to roll up and smother the tree, they broke
out in a storm of joy-clamors. &nbsp;I got enough breath to say:</p>

<p>"Proceed, my liege; after you is manners."</p>

<p>The king gasped:</p>

<p>"Follow me down, and then back thyself against one side of the
trunk, and leave me the other. &nbsp;Then will we fight. &nbsp;Let each pile
his dead according to his own fashion and taste."</p>

<p>Then he descended, barking and coughing, and I followed. &nbsp;I struck
the ground an instant after him; we sprang to our appointed places,
and began to give and take with all our might. &nbsp;The powwow and
racket were prodigious; it was a tempest of riot and confusion and
thick-falling blows. &nbsp;Suddenly some horsemen tore into the midst
of the crowd, and a voice shouted:</p>

<p>"Hold&mdash;or ye are dead men!"</p>

<p>How good it sounded! &nbsp;The owner of the voice bore all the marks of
a gentleman: &nbsp;picturesque and costly raiment, the aspect of command,
a hard countenance, with complexion and features marred by dissipation.
The mob fell humbly back, like so many spaniels. &nbsp;The gentleman
inspected us critically, then said sharply to the peasants:</p>

<p>"What are ye doing to these people?"</p>

<p>"They be madmen, worshipful sir, that have come wandering we know
not whence, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ye know not whence? &nbsp;Do ye pretend ye know them not?"</p>

<p>"Most honored sir, we speak but the truth. &nbsp;They are strangers
and unknown to any in this region; and they be the most violent
and bloodthirsty madmen that ever&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Peace! &nbsp;Ye know not what ye say. &nbsp;They are not mad. &nbsp;Who are ye?
And whence are ye? &nbsp;Explain."</p>

<p>"We are but peaceful strangers, sir," I said, "and traveling upon
our own concerns. &nbsp;We are from a far country, and unacquainted
here. &nbsp;We have purposed no harm; and yet but for your brave
interference and protection these people would have killed us.
As you have divined, sir, we are not mad; neither are we violent
or bloodthirsty."</p>

<p>The gentleman turned to his retinue and said calmly: &nbsp;"Lash me
these animals to their kennels!"</p>

<p>The mob vanished in an instant; and after them plunged the horsemen,
laying about them with their whips and pitilessly riding down such
as were witless enough to keep the road instead of taking to the
bush. &nbsp;The shrieks and supplications presently died away in the
distance, and soon the horsemen began to straggle back. &nbsp;Meantime
the gentleman had been questioning us more closely, but had dug
no particulars out of us. &nbsp;We were lavish of recognition of the
service he was doing us, but we revealed nothing more than that we
were friendless strangers from a far country. &nbsp;When the escort were
all returned, the gentleman said to one of his servants:</p>

<p>"Bring the led-horses and mount these people."</p>

<p>"Yes, my lord."</p>

<p>We were placed toward the rear, among the servants. &nbsp;We traveled
pretty fast, and finally drew rein some time after dark at a
roadside inn some ten or twelve miles from the scene of our
troubles. &nbsp;My lord went immediately to his room, after ordering
his supper, and we saw no more of him. &nbsp;At dawn in the morning
we breakfasted and made ready to start.</p>

<p>My lord's chief attendant sauntered forward at that moment with
indolent grace, and said:</p>

<p>"Ye have said ye should continue upon this road, which is our
direction likewise; wherefore my lord, the earl Grip, hath given
commandment that ye retain the horses and ride, and that certain
of us ride with ye a twenty mile to a fair town that hight Cambenet,
whenso ye shall be out of peril."</p>

<br><br><br><br>

<img alt="34-447.jpg (24K)" src="images/34-447.jpg" height="367" width="350">
</center>
<br><br><br><br>

<p>We could do nothing less than express our thanks and accept the
offer. &nbsp;We jogged along, six in the party, at a moderate and
comfortable gait, and in conversation learned that my lord Grip
was a very great personage in his own region, which lay a day's
journey beyond Cambenet. &nbsp;We loitered to such a degree that it was
near the middle of the forenoon when we entered the market square
of the town. &nbsp;We dismounted, and left our thanks once more for
my lord, and then approached a crowd assembled in the center of
the square, to see what might be the object of interest. &nbsp;It was the
remnant of that old peregrinating band of slaves! &nbsp;So they had
been dragging their chains about, all this weary time. &nbsp;That poor
husband was gone, and also many others; and some few purchases
had been added to the gang. &nbsp;The king was not interested, and
wanted to move along, but I was absorbed, and full of pity. &nbsp;I could
not take my eyes away from these worn and wasted wrecks of humanity.
There they sat, grounded upon the ground, silent, uncomplaining,
with bowed heads, a pathetic sight. &nbsp;And by hideous contrast, a
redundant orator was making a speech to another gathering not thirty
steps away, in fulsome laudation of "our glorious British liberties!"</p>

<p>I was boiling. &nbsp;I had forgotten I was a plebeian, I was remembering
I was a man. &nbsp;Cost what it might, I would mount that rostrum and&mdash;</p>

<p>Click! the king and I were handcuffed together! &nbsp;Our companions,
those servants, had done it; my lord Grip stood looking on. &nbsp;The
king burst out in a fury, and said:</p>

<p>"What meaneth this ill-mannered jest?"</p>

<p>My lord merely said to his head miscreant, coolly:</p>

<p>"Put up the slaves and sell them!"</p>

<p><i>Slaves!</i>  &nbsp;The word had a new sound&mdash;and how unspeakably awful! &nbsp;The
king lifted his manacles and brought them down with a deadly force;
but my lord was out of the way when they arrived. &nbsp;A dozen of
the rascal's servants sprang forward, and in a moment we were
helpless, with our hands bound behind us. &nbsp;We so loudly and so
earnestly proclaimed ourselves freemen, that we got the interested
attention of that liberty-mouthing orator and his patriotic crowd,
and they gathered about us and assumed a very determined attitude.
The orator said:</p>

<p>"If, indeed, ye are freemen, ye have nought to fear&mdash;the God-given
liberties of Britain are about ye for your shield and shelter!
(Applause.) &nbsp;Ye shall soon see. Bring forth your proofs."</p>

<p>"What proofs?"</p>

<p>"Proof that ye are freemen."</p>

<p>Ah&mdash;I remembered! &nbsp;I came to myself; I said nothing. &nbsp;But the
king stormed out:</p>

<p>"Thou'rt insane, man. &nbsp;It were better, and more in reason, that
this thief and scoundrel here prove that we are <i>not</i>  freemen."</p>

<p>You see, he knew his own laws just as other people so often know
the laws; by words, not by effects. &nbsp;They take a <i>meaning</i> , and get
to be very vivid, when you come to apply them to yourself.</p>

<p>All hands shook their heads and looked disappointed; some turned
away, no longer interested. &nbsp;The orator said&mdash;and this time in the
tones of business, not of sentiment:</p>

<p>"An ye do not know your country's laws, it were time ye learned
them. &nbsp;Ye are strangers to us; ye will not deny that. Ye may be
freemen, we do not deny that; but also ye may be slaves. &nbsp;The law
is clear: &nbsp;it doth not require the claimant to prove ye are slaves,
it requireth you to prove ye are not."</p>

<p>I said:</p>

<p>"Dear sir, give us only time to send to Astolat; or give us only
time to send to the Valley of Holiness&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Peace, good man, these are extraordinary requests, and you may
not hope to have them granted. &nbsp;It would cost much time, and would
unwarrantably inconvenience your master&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<i>Master</i> , idiot!" stormed the king. &nbsp;"I have no master, I myself
am the m&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Silence, for God's sake!"</p>

<p>I got the words out in time to stop the king. &nbsp;We were in trouble
enough already; it could not help us any to give these people
the notion that we were lunatics.</p>

<p>There is no use in stringing out the details. &nbsp;The earl put us up
and sold us at auction. &nbsp;This same infernal law had existed in
our own South in my own time, more than thirteen hundred years
later, and under it hundreds of freemen who could not prove that
they were freemen had been sold into lifelong slavery without
the circumstance making any particular impression upon me; but the
minute law and the auction block came into my personal experience,
a thing which had been merely improper before became suddenly
hellish. &nbsp;Well, that's the way we are made.</p>

<p>Yes, we were sold at auction, like swine. &nbsp;In a big town and an
active market we should have brought a good price; but this place
was utterly stagnant and so we sold at a figure which makes me
ashamed, every time I think of it. &nbsp;The King of England brought
seven dollars, and his prime minister nine; whereas the king was
easily worth twelve dollars and I as easily worth fifteen. &nbsp;But
that is the way things always go; if you force a sale on a dull
market, I don't care what the property is, you are going to make
a poor business of it, and you can make up your mind to it. &nbsp;If
the earl had had wit enough to&mdash;</p>

<p>However, there is no occasion for my working my sympathies up
on his account. &nbsp;Let him go, for the present; I took his number,
so to speak.</p>

<p>The slave-dealer bought us both, and hitched us onto that long
chain of his, and we constituted the rear of his procession. &nbsp;We
took up our line of march and passed out of Cambenet at noon;
and it seemed to me unaccountably strange and odd that the King
of England and his chief minister, marching manacled and fettered
and yoked, in a slave convoy, could move by all manner of idle men
and women, and under windows where sat the sweet and the lovely,
and yet never attract a curious eye, never provoke a single remark.
Dear, dear, it only shows that there is nothing diviner about a king
than there is about a tramp, after all. &nbsp;He is just a cheap and
hollow artificiality when you don't know he is a king. &nbsp;But reveal
his quality, and dear me it takes your very breath away to look
at him. &nbsp;I reckon we are all fools. Born so, no doubt.</p>

<br><br><br><br>

<p>A PITIFUL INCIDENT</p>

<p>It's a world of surprises. &nbsp;The king brooded; this was natural.
What would he brood about, should you say? &nbsp;Why, about the prodigious
nature of his fall, of course&mdash;from the loftiest place in the world
to the lowest; from the most illustrious station in the world to
the obscurest; from the grandest vocation among men to the basest.
No, I take my oath that the thing that graveled him most, to start
with, was not this, but the price he had fetched! &nbsp;He couldn't
seem to get over that seven dollars. &nbsp;Well, it stunned me so, when
I first found it out, that I couldn't believe it; it didn't seem
natural. &nbsp;But as soon as my mental sight cleared and I got a right
focus on it, I saw I was mistaken; it <i>was</i>  natural. &nbsp;For this
reason: &nbsp;a king is a mere artificiality, and so a king's feelings,
like the impulses of an automatic doll, are mere artificialities;
but as a man, he is a reality, and his feelings, as a man, are
real, not phantoms. &nbsp;It shames the average man to be valued below
his own estimate of his worth, and the king certainly wasn't
anything more than an average man, if he was up that high.</p>

<p>Confound him, he wearied me with arguments to show that in anything
like a fair market he would have fetched twenty-five dollars,
sure&mdash;a thing which was plainly nonsense, and full or the baldest
conceit; I wasn't worth it myself. &nbsp;But it was tender ground for
me to argue on. &nbsp;In fact, I had to simply shirk argument and do
the diplomatic instead. &nbsp;I had to throw conscience aside, and
brazenly concede that he ought to have brought twenty-five dollars;
whereas I was quite well aware that in all the ages, the world had
never seen a king that was worth half the money, and during the
next thirteen centuries wouldn't see one that was worth the fourth
of it. &nbsp;Yes, he tired me. &nbsp;If he began to talk about the crops;
or about the recent weather; or about the condition of politics;
or about dogs, or cats, or morals, or theology&mdash;no matter
what&mdash;I sighed, for I knew what was coming; he was going to get out of it
a palliation of that tiresome seven-dollar sale. &nbsp;Wherever we
halted where there was a crowd, he would give me a look which
said plainly: &nbsp;"if that thing could be tried over again now, with
this kind of folk, you would see a different result." &nbsp;Well, when
he was first sold, it secretly tickled me to see him go for seven
dollars; but before he was done with his sweating and worrying
I wished he had fetched a hundred. &nbsp;The thing never got a chance
to die, for every day, at one place or another, possible purchasers
looked us over, and, as often as any other way, their comment on
the king was something like this:</p>

<p>"Here's a two-dollar-and-a-half chump with a thirty-dollar style.
Pity but style was marketable."</p>

<p>At last this sort of remark produced an evil result. &nbsp;Our owner
was a practical person and he perceived that this defect must be
mended if he hoped to find a purchaser for the king. &nbsp;So he went
to work to take the style out of his sacred majesty. &nbsp;I could have
given the man some valuable advice, but I didn't; you mustn't
volunteer advice to a slave-driver unless you want to damage
the cause you are arguing for. &nbsp;I had found it a sufficiently
difficult job to reduce the king's style to a peasant's style,
even when he was a willing and anxious pupil; now then, to undertake
to reduce the king's style to a slave's style&mdash;and by force&mdash;go to!
it was a stately contract. &nbsp;Never mind the details&mdash;it will save me
trouble to let you imagine them. &nbsp;I will only remark that at the
end of a week there was plenty of evidence that lash and club
and fist had done their work well; the king's body was a sight
to see&mdash;and to weep over; but his spirit?&mdash;why, it wasn't even
phased. &nbsp;Even that dull clod of a slave-driver was able to see
that there can be such a thing as a slave who will remain a man
till he dies; whose bones you can break, but whose manhood you
can't. &nbsp;This man found that from his first effort down to his
latest, he couldn't ever come within reach of the king, but the
king was ready to plunge for him, and did it. &nbsp;So he gave up
at last, and left the king in possession of his style unimpaired.
The fact is, the king was a good deal more than a king, he was
a man; and when a man is a man, you can't knock it out of him.</p>

<br><br><br><br>

<br><br><br><br>

<p>We had a rough time for a month, tramping to and fro in the earth,
and suffering. &nbsp;And what Englishman was the most interested in
the slavery question by that time? &nbsp;His grace the king! &nbsp;Yes; from
being the most indifferent, he was become the most interested.
He was become the bitterest hater of the institution I had ever
heard talk. &nbsp;And so I ventured to ask once more a question which
I had asked years before and had gotten such a sharp answer that
I had not thought it prudent to meddle in the matter further.
Would he abolish slavery?</p>

<p>His answer was as sharp as before, but it was music this time;
I shouldn't ever wish to hear pleasanter, though the profanity
was not good, being awkwardly put together, and with the crash-word
almost in the middle instead of at the end, where, of course, it
ought to have been.</p>

<p>I was ready and willing to get free now; I hadn't wanted to get
free any sooner. &nbsp;No, I cannot quite say that. &nbsp;I had wanted to,
but I had not been willing to take desperate chances, and had
always dissuaded the king from them. &nbsp;But now&mdash;ah, it was a new
atmosphere! &nbsp;Liberty would be worth any cost that might be put
upon it now. &nbsp;I set about a plan, and was straightway charmed
with it. &nbsp;It would require time, yes, and patience, too, a great
deal of both. &nbsp;One could invent quicker ways, and fully as sure
ones; but none that would be as picturesque as this; none that
could be made so dramatic. &nbsp;And so I was not going to give this
one up. &nbsp;It might delay us months, but no matter, I would carry
it out or break something.</p>

<p>Now and then we had an adventure. &nbsp;One night we were overtaken
by a snow-storm while still a mile from the village we were making
for. &nbsp;Almost instantly we were shut up as in a fog, the driving
snow was so thick. &nbsp;You couldn't see a thing, and we were soon
lost. &nbsp;The slave-driver lashed us desperately, for he saw ruin
before him, but his lashings only made matters worse, for they
drove us further from the road and from likelihood of succor.
So we had to stop at last and slump down in the snow where we
were. &nbsp;The storm continued until toward midnight, then ceased.
By this time two of our feebler men and three of our women were
dead, and others past moving and threatened with death. &nbsp;Our
master was nearly beside himself. &nbsp;He stirred up the living, and
made us stand, jump, slap ourselves, to restore our circulation,
and he helped as well as he could with his whip.</p>

<p>Now came a diversion. &nbsp;We heard shrieks and yells, and soon a
woman came running and crying; and seeing our group, she flung
herself into our midst and begged for protection. &nbsp;A mob of people
came tearing after her, some with torches, and they said she was a
witch who had caused several cows to die by a strange disease,
and practiced her arts by help of a devil in the form of a black
cat. &nbsp;This poor woman had been stoned until she hardly looked
human, she was so battered and bloody. &nbsp;The mob wanted to burn her.</p>

<p>Well, now, what do you suppose our master did? &nbsp;When we closed
around this poor creature to shelter her, he saw his chance. &nbsp;He
said, burn her here, or they shouldn't have her at all. &nbsp;Imagine
that! &nbsp;They were willing. &nbsp;They fastened her to a post; they
brought wood and piled it about her; they applied the torch while
she shrieked and pleaded and strained her two young daughters
to her breast; and our brute, with a heart solely for business,
lashed us into position about the stake and warmed us into life
and commercial value by the same fire which took away the innocent
life of that poor harmless mother. &nbsp;That was the sort of master we
had. &nbsp;I took <i>his</i>  number. &nbsp;That snow-storm cost him nine of his
flock; and he was more brutal to us than ever, after that, for
many days together, he was so enraged over his loss.</p>

<p>We had adventures all along. &nbsp;One day we ran into a procession.
And such a procession! &nbsp;All the riffraff of the kingdom seemed
to be comprehended in it; and all drunk at that. &nbsp;In the van was
a cart with a coffin in it, and on the coffin sat a comely young
girl of about eighteen suckling a baby, which she squeezed to her
breast in a passion of love every little while, and every little
while wiped from its face the tears which her eyes rained down
upon it; and always the foolish little thing smiled up at her,
happy and content, kneading her breast with its dimpled fat hand,
which she patted and fondled right over her breaking heart.</p>

</center>
<br><br><br><br>


<p>Men and women, boys and girls, trotted along beside or after
the cart, hooting, shouting profane and ribald remarks, singing
snatches of foul song, skipping, dancing&mdash;a very holiday of
hellions, a sickening sight. &nbsp;We had struck a suburb of London,
outside the walls, and this was a sample of one sort of London
society. &nbsp;Our master secured a good place for us near the gallows.
A priest was in attendance, and he helped the girl climb up, and
said comforting words to her, and made the under-sheriff provide
a stool for her. &nbsp;Then he stood there by her on the gallows, and
for a moment looked down upon the mass of upturned faces at his
feet, then out over the solid pavement of heads that stretched away
on every side occupying the vacancies far and near, and then began
to tell the story of the case. &nbsp;And there was pity in his
voice&mdash;how seldom a sound that was in that ignorant and savage land!
I remember every detail of what he said, except the words he said
it in; and so I change it into my own words:</p>

<p>"Law is intended to mete out justice. &nbsp;Sometimes it fails. This
cannot be helped. &nbsp;We can only grieve, and be resigned, and pray
for the soul of him who falls unfairly by the arm of the law, and
that his fellows may be few. &nbsp;A law sends this poor young thing
to death&mdash;and it is right. &nbsp;But another law had placed her where
she must commit her crime or starve with her child&mdash;and before God
that law is responsible for both her crime and her ignominious death!</p>

<p>"A little while ago this young thing, this child of eighteen years,
was as happy a wife and mother as any in England; and her lips
were blithe with song, which is the native speech of glad and
innocent hearts. &nbsp;Her young husband was as happy as she; for he was
doing his whole duty, he worked early and late at his handicraft,
his bread was honest bread well and fairly earned, he was prospering,
he was furnishing shelter and sustenance to his family, he was
adding his mite to the wealth of the nation. &nbsp;By consent of a
treacherous law, instant destruction fell upon this holy home and
swept it away! &nbsp;That young husband was waylaid and impressed,
and sent to sea. &nbsp;The wife knew nothing of it. &nbsp;She sought him
everywhere, she moved the hardest hearts with the supplications
of her tears, the broken eloquence of her despair. &nbsp;Weeks dragged
by, she watching, waiting, hoping, her mind going slowly to wreck
under the burden of her misery. &nbsp;Little by little all her small
possessions went for food. &nbsp;When she could no longer pay her rent,
they turned her out of doors. &nbsp;She begged, while she had strength;
when she was starving at last, and her milk failing, she stole a
piece of linen cloth of the value of a fourth part of a cent,
thinking to sell it and save her child. &nbsp;But she was seen by the
owner of the cloth. &nbsp;She was put in jail and brought to trial.
The man testified to the facts. &nbsp;A plea was made for her, and her
sorrowful story was told in her behalf. &nbsp;She spoke, too, by
permission, and said she did steal the cloth, but that her mind
was so disordered of late by trouble that when she was overborne
with hunger all acts, criminal or other, swam meaningless through
her brain and she knew nothing rightly, except that she was so
hungry! &nbsp;For a moment all were touched, and there was disposition
to deal mercifully with her, seeing that she was so young and
friendless, and her case so piteous, and the law that robbed her
of her support to blame as being the first and only cause of her
transgression; but the prosecuting officer replied that whereas
these things were all true, and most pitiful as well, still there
was much small theft in these days, and mistimed mercy here would
be a danger to property&mdash;oh, my God, is there no property in ruined
homes, and orphaned babes, and broken hearts that British law
holds precious!&mdash;and so he must require sentence.</p>

<p>"When the judge put on his black cap, the owner of the stolen
linen rose trembling up, his lip quivering, his face as gray as
ashes; and when the awful words came, he cried out, 'Oh, poor
child, poor child, I did not know it was death!' and fell as a
tree falls. &nbsp;When they lifted him up his reason was gone; before
the sun was set, he had taken his own life. &nbsp;A kindly man; a man
whose heart was right, at bottom; add his murder to this that
is to be now done here; and charge them both where they
belong&mdash;to the rulers and the bitter laws of Britain. &nbsp;The time is come, my
child; let me pray over thee&mdash;not <i>for</i>  thee, dear abused poor heart
and innocent, but for them that be guilty of thy ruin and death,
who need it more."</p>

<p>After his prayer they put the noose around the young girl's neck,
and they had great trouble to adjust the knot under her ear,
because she was devouring the baby all the time, wildly kissing it,
and snatching it to her face and her breast, and drenching it
with tears, and half moaning, half shrieking all the while, and the
baby crowing, and laughing, and kicking its feet with delight over
what it took for romp and play. &nbsp;Even the hangman couldn't stand it,
but turned away. &nbsp;When all was ready the priest gently pulled and
tugged and forced the child out of the mother's arms, and stepped
quickly out of her reach; but she clasped her hands, and made a
wild spring toward him, with a shriek; but the rope&mdash;and the
under-sheriff&mdash;held her short. &nbsp;Then she went on her knees and
stretched out her hands and cried:</p>

<p>"One more kiss&mdash;oh, my God, one more, one more,&mdash;it is the dying
that begs it!"</p>

<p>She got it; she almost smothered the little thing. &nbsp;And when they
got it away again, she cried out:</p>

<p>"Oh, my child, my darling, it will die! &nbsp;It has no home, it has
no father, no friend, no mother&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It has them all!" said that good priest. &nbsp;"All these will I be
to it till I die."</p>

<p>You should have seen her face then! &nbsp;Gratitude? &nbsp;Lord, what do
you want with words to express that? &nbsp;Words are only painted fire;
a look is the fire itself. &nbsp;She gave that look, and carried it away
to the treasury of heaven, where all things that are divine belong.</p>

such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
